What is Robot Class?

	1. Robot class is a part java API AWT package.
	2. Robot class is used to generate native system input events to control mouse and keyboard events.

Why we need a AWT package which is not a part of WebDriver API?

	1. When a user needs to handle alert pop-ups on the webpage.
	2. When a user wants to enter text in windows pop-ups with a combination of modifier keys such as SHIFT, ALT.

Why we need Robot Class?

	� Selenium WebDriver cannot handle windows pop-ups so to handle native OS pop ups we need Robot Class.
	
Why we cannot use Action Class methods to handle mouse and keyboard events on desktop pop-ups?

	� Action class method needs WebElement objects to perform actions.
	� Desktop pop-up doesn't not have locator, so we use robot class methods to perform keyboard and mouse events on desktop-pop-ups.

How to use Robot Class methods?

	1. Import the java.awt.Robot package
	2. Create a Robot Class Object and instantiate
	3. Using Robot Class Object invoke the methods.
	

	


Mouse Events
�
	� mousePress(int buttons)- Press one or more mouse buttons. Buttons are the Button mask is a combination of one or more mouse button masks.
�
Standard Button Masks Methods in Mouse Press
�
	1. InputEvent.BUTTON1_DOWN_MASK- For mouse left click
	2. InputEvent.BUTTON2_DOWN_MASK- For mouse middle button click
	3. InputEvent.BUTTON3_DOWN_MASK- For mouse right click
�
	� mouseRelease- Releases one or more mouse buttons.
�
	� mouseMove- Move the mouse pointer to the given screen position. Here x is X position, y is Y position in the coordinates.

Keyboard Events

	� keyPress(int keycode)- 
	Press the given key. 
	Keycode is an integer value for the pressed key.
	� keyPress(keyEvent.VK_A)
	
	� keyRelease(int keycode)
	Release the given key.
	� keyRelease(keyEvent.VK_SHIFT)
	
	
KeyEvent

	1. KeyEvent is a low level event.
	2. In java awt package low level events are events that indicate direct communication from the users like keyPress, keyRelease, Move, Mouse Click.
	3. keyEvent indicates an event occurs on pressing, releasing, or typing a text on the component object like a text field.
	4. keyEvent contains constant fields like:
		a. For Alphabets, from VK_A till VK_Z
		b. For Numbers from VK_0 till VK_9
		c. For Special Characters VK_Dollar for $ key.

	
	
	
	
	Advantages:
	� It provides control over the Keyboard as well as Mouse events.
	� It offers a way to handle an interaction with Operating system pop-ups support of which is not possible with Selenium Web Driver API.
	� Robot class is especially useful in managing file upload/download actions by interacting with OS pop-ups.
	� It is easy to consume in the java Selenium scripts as this class is part of Java package.
	�
	Limitations:
	� Most of the methods like mouseMove are dependent on screen resolution, so, the method may perform differently on different screens.
	� This class�acts only on the window in focus, so the behaviour may differ when multiple windows open.
	� Switching between different frames or windows is difficult with Robot methods.
